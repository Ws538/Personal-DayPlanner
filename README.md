# Personal-DayPlanner

## Description

The aim of this small project was to create a time sensitive working day planner with DayJS and also could save data locally.
In our everyday working lives, everyone has some form of a 'to do list' one way or the other. The idea of a working day planner with an active colour change to match the time of day soloved that problem. A planner that could save your todo lists and not only keeping track of the date but also the hour of day, changing colours for past, present and future by the hour.

## Usage

Using this Day planner is super easy. Simply jot down what needs to be done during each hour section and hit the save button to the right. This will automatically save the data to the local storage so you wont have to worry about it dissapearing unless you want to change it, then simply remove the text and add a new one and hit the save button again. 

As the Day planner has APIs from DayjS, the time is shown at the top of the page, as each working day hour passes, the past hours will be shown in grey, present will be shown in red and future hours will be shown in green as shown below.
